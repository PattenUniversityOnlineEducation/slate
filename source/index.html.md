# Introduction

Welcome to the Patten One Platform third party organization API! You can use our API to access student registry API endpoints, which can get information on student enrollment information, grades, and so on in our database.

Request base url(baseUrl): 

`https://app.patten.edu:4000/api/`


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: Bear <token>"
```

> Make sure to replace `token` with your API key.

One Platform uses API token to allow access to the API. You can register a new One Platform API token by contacting our tech support team: [support@sv.patten.edu](support@sv.patten.edu).

Kittn expects for the API token to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bear <token>`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>token</code> with your personal API token.
